	<p><a href="https://github.com/swaminathanj/ProblemSolving/blob/master/Home.md">1. Problem Solving using Programming</a></p>
	    <p>This course is about learning computer programming by problem solving. The course is broadly divided into three
		units. The essential constructs of C language (for problem solving) are introduced at the beginning of each unit 
		really quick. This is followed by a long duration of problem solving. To get started, five problems from code forces 
		are selected and the incremental approach to solving them demostrated. Modularity is emphasized throughout. The
	        students are encouraged to break the solution into functions rather than implement the entire logic in main. While it  
		might seem unneccesary to define functions for really simple problems, the expectation is that students learn the
		art of developing programs as building blocks. How else does one apply modularity for large software unless he/she
		has learnt to apply it for smaller programs?

	<p><a href="oop/01_intro.html">2. Object Oriented Programming</a></p>
	    <p>This is a course on object oriented programming using Java. The initial emphasis of the course is on object oriented
	    paradigm with almost zero use of any Java libraries. All the major features of object orientation such as encapsulation,
	    polymorphism, composition, inheritance, interface and exception handling, are introduced and wound around single 
	    application example to enable the learner to assimilate the underlying principles. In the second phase, the essential 
	    librarires of core Java such as math, string and file handling are introduced. In the final phase, advanced features 
	    such as generics, collections, swings, multi-threading, serialization and UML design notations are introduced. The
	    students are strongly encouraged to design and implement a 1000-LOC project.</p>
