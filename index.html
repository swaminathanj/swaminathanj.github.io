	    <p>This course is about learning computer programming by problem solving. The course is broadly divided into three
		units. The essential constructs of C language (for problem solving) are introduced at the beginning of each unit 
		really quick. This is followed by an extended duration of problem solving. To get started, 5 problems from code forces 
		are selected and the incremental approach to solving them demostrated. Modularity is emphasized throughout. The
	        students are encouraged to break the solution into functions rather than implement the entire logic in main. While it  
		might seem unneccesary to define functions for really simple problems, the expectation is that students learn the
		art of developing programs as building blocks. How else does one apply modularity for large software unless he/she
		has learnt to apply it for smaller programs?

	<p><a href="oop/01_intro.html">2. Object Oriented Programming</a></p>
	    <p>This is a course on object oriented programming using Java. The initial emphasis of the course is on object oriented
	    paradigm with almost zero use of any Java libraries. All the major features of object orientation such as encapsulation,
	    polymorphism, composition, inheritance, interface and exception handling, are introduced and wound around single 
	    application example to enable the learner to assimilate the underlying principles. In the second phase, the essential 
	    librarires of core Java such as math, string and file handling are introduced. In the final phase, advanced features 
	    such as generics, collections, swings, multi-threading, serialization and UML design notations are introduced. The
	    students are strongly encouraged to design and implement a 1000-LOC project.</p>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/swaminathanj/DSA/blob/master/Lectures.md">3. Data Structures and Algorithms</a></p>
	    <p>This course focuses on fundamental data structures including linked list, stack, queue, binary tree, binary heap,
	    binary search tree, graphs disjoint sets and hash tables. The course emphasizes on incremental approach towards
	    implementation and modularity. The treatment is object oriented and the language used is Java. Broadly, there are two 
	    goals to this course. The first one being implementing the data structures themselves. The second one is to determine
	    the right data structure for a given problem and apply them. It is also important to develop the ability to design
	    new data structures or variants of existing ones when required.</p>
	<p><a href="algo/01_Intro.html">4. Design and Analysis of Algorithms</a></p>
	    <p>This is a standard course on algorithm design and analysis. The course starts with the need for efficient
	    algorithms and methods to measure the efficiency in terms of time and space. This is followed by the introduction
	    to asysmptotic notations, solving recurrences and Master's method. The next phase of the course moves to classical
	    problems on algorithms and strategies to solve them such as divide-and-conquer, greedy and dynamic programming.
	    The problems center around arrays, strings, trees and graphs. In the final phase, other strategies such as 
	    backtracking, branch-and-bound and problem-specific techniques are covered. The course ends with a short discussion
	    on NP, NP-Hard and NP-Complete topics and reductions.</p>
